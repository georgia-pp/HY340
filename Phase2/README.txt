 Everything was implemented according to the specifications of the assignment
 to create a complete Syntax Analyzer for the Alpha language using Flex and Bison/YACC.
 There is a Makefile included with which you can compile all the files of the project using
 the command make all. 
 The file SymbolTable.h contains the class of the symbol table and the class of the symbolTable
 entries which is the type of the objects that are going to be inserted into the symbol table.
 The file SymbolTable.cpp contains the implementations of the two classes mentioned above.
